# Distance to place
A map application that shows a location. When the application starts, a view of the location will be displayed. Each polygon is clickable and displays information. If site access is allowed, the user can see the distance between user location and current location.

The app uses [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/) & Mapbox. Visit [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to get an api key.
An easy way to draw polygons is to use the service at [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/)
